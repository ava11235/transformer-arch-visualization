## 🎯 What This Shows

This visualization demonstrates a **fill-in-the-blank prediction task** where a transformer model:
- **Input:** "The cat is [MASK]"
- **Process:** Analyzes the sentence structure and context
- **Output:** Predicts likely words like "sleeping" (70%), "sitting" (20%), "walking" (10%)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Step-by-Step Animation** - Click through each stage of processing
- **Visual Attention Matrices** - See how words relate to each other
- **Real Numerical Examples** - Actual embedding values and attention weights
- **Simplified Explanations** - Technical concepts explained in plain language
- **Self-Contained** - No installation or dependencies required

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Core Transformer Components:
1. **Input Processing** - Tokenization and position encoding
2. **Embedding Layer** - Converting words to numerical vectors
3. **Encoder** - Self-attention and feed-forward processing
4. **Decoder** - Masked attention and cross-attention mechanisms
5. **Output** - Probability generation for word prediction

### Key Concepts Visualized:
- **Attention Mechanisms** - How words "look at" other words
- **Positional Encoding** - Why word order matters
- **Embeddings** - How meaning is captured numerically
- **ReLU Activation** - Non-linear processing in neural networks
- **Masked Attention** - Preventing models from "cheating" by looking ahead

## 📝 Example Walkthrough

The visualization follows "The cat is [MASK]" through:
1. **Tokenization:** Words → Numbers (cat → 5678)
2. **Embeddings:** Numbers → Meaning vectors ([0.6, -0.4, 0.2...])
3. **Attention:** "cat" focuses on "is" (what it might do)
4. **Processing:** Enhanced understanding through neural networks
5. **Prediction:** "sleeping" emerges as most likely (70% confidence)

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After using this visualization, you'll understand:
- How transformers process sequential text
- Why attention mechanisms are revolutionary
- How position and context influence predictions
- The role of embeddings in capturing meaning
